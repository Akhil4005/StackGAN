# Text-to-Image Synthesis with StackGAN

This repository implements a model for synthesizing photo-realistic images from textual descriptions using the **Stacked Generative Adversarial Networks (StackGAN)**. The model takes in a textual description of an image and produces realistic images with high fidelity.

## Overview

### What is StackGAN?

StackGAN is an advanced architecture that addresses the challenging problem of generating high-quality images from text. It breaks the task into two stages:
1. **Stage-I GAN**: Generates low-resolution images (64x64) that capture basic shapes and colors based on the text description.
2. **Stage-II GAN**: Refines the image from Stage-I, adding realistic details to generate high-resolution images (256x256).

This two-stage process enables the model to focus on different aspects of the image generation task at each stage, resulting in sharper and more realistic images.

## Model Architecture

The model uses a combination of two Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), working in tandem to produce photo-realistic images. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the architecture:

### Stage-I GAN: Generating Basic Shapes and Colors

- **Input**: Encoded textual description of the image.
- **Output**: 64x64 low-resolution image.
- **Goal**: Generate a rough representation of the image that aligns with the textual description, ensuring that major elements like color, shape, and composition are present.

### Stage-II GAN: Refining the Image

- **Input**: Low-resolution image from Stage-I and the encoded text.
- **Output**: 256x256 high-resolution image with enhanced details.
- **Goal**: Add fine details to the image, such as texture and sharpness, while ensuring consistency with the text description.

## Key Features

- **Two-Stage GAN Approach**: The model splits the image generation task into two stages to progressively build the image, making the training more stable and resulting in higher-quality outputs.
- **Text-to-Image Generation**: Unlike traditional GANs, StackGAN is conditioned on text inputs, enabling the generation of images based on textual descriptions.
- **Scalability**: The architecture can be adapted to work with larger image sizes and different datasets.
- **Deep Learning Techniques**: The model employs deep convolutional layers and advanced loss functions to optimize both image quality and textual relevance.
